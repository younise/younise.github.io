VMware Software Manager – Download Service 1.0 release coincides with the launch of vSphere 6.0. This tool is to assist with the download management of VMware products. It’s an easy button to download all the bits for a particular suite or individual products. The download catalog is currently limited to the following Datacenter and Cloud infrastructure products:

- VMware vCloud Suite 6.0, 5.8, and 5.5
- VMware vSphere w/ Operations Management 6.0 and 5.5
- VMware vSphere 6.0, 5.5, and 5.1

There is a detection mechanism that is aware when a new suite, product, and version are available. Another benefit is an integrity check that validates all downloads. The Software Manager – Download Service has the following requirements:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Operating Systems**</span>

- Windows 8.1 64-bit
- Windows 7 64-bit SP2
- Windows Server 2012 64-bit R2
- Windows Server 2008 64-bit R2 SP1

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Supported Browsers**</span>

- Internet Explorer 10 and 11
- Firefox 34 and 35
- Google Chrome 39 and 40

The installation and setup is simple and requires minimal time. The MSI is close to 17mb in in size and can be found [here](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=VSMDS10_GA&productId=486&rPId=7507%200B). The installation also requires a location for the software depot. The minimal requirement for the software depot is 80GB. Along with each product is the download size which will assist in determining the necessary size for your software depot. I would recommend a separate disk that can be allocated to your software depot to be used as a central repository.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Summary**</span>

VMware Software Manager – Download Service is tool that allows downloading VMware products in a simple manner. There are few features I would like to see added, such as support for Mac OS X and Linux operating systems, and notifications for when new versions or downloads are available and have completed. Some other helpful features would be proxy settings for those environments that require it, and download of plugins for those products that have them available. This is a great start for a new 1.0 tool, and I am looking forward to seeing how the product will evolve.
