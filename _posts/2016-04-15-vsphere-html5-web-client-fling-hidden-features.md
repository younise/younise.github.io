![](https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2016/04/HTML5-Fling-icon-1.1.png?resize=166%2C166)I recently wrote about the <span style="color: #3366ff;">**[release of the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling](http://emadyounis.com/vcenter/new-fling-vsphere-html5-web-client/)**</span> and <span style="color: #3366ff;">**[how to configure](http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2016/03/vsphere-html5-web-client-fling-getting-started.html)** </span>it. Since then there has already been an **<span style="color: #3366ff;">[update to the Fling](https://labs.vmware.com/flings/vsphere-html5-web-client)</span>**. I‚Äôve gone through update process in my lab using the rpm, but I also decided to deploy a new OVA (version 1.1) and found a few hidden features.

During the configuration of the appliance I found a directory called ‚Äúvspherefeatures‚Äù. The directory contains a configuration file with three disabled entries. Of course the first thing that came to mind is what‚Äôs the harm in just enabling one to see what happens. What happened was me enabling all three after seeing the first one worked.

The Three hidden features are Datastore File Browser, Add Host Wizard, and Network Selector. I‚Äôm assuming that these are features that will be available in future releases of the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling. For now looks like we can get a sneak peak üôÇ

**Enabling Hidden Features**

<span style="color: #ff0000;">**Note:**</span> This was tested using a new vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling version 1.1 OVA.

1. SSH into vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling Appliance.
2. Go to **/etc/vmware/vsphere-client/vsphereFeatures**

3. Edit the configuration file **‚ÄúvsphereFeatures.cfg**‚Äù I‚Äôm using VI to make changes.

**Features**

The Datastore File Browser feature can be found by going to Storage and selecting a Datastore ‚Äì&gt; Manage ‚Äì&gt; Files. Here you can download files, create files, search within a datastore, and delete files or folders.

Add Host Wizard can be found by performing a right click at the Datacenter level or using Datacenter Actions. We now have the ability to add a new ESXi host.

There you have it three hidden features that are not currently available today in the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling. I would keep an eye out on this configuration file as new updates are released there may be more hidden features. Now if you‚Äôll excuse me I have some feedback to provide üôÇ
