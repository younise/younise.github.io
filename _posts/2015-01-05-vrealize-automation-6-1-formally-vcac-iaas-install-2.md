IaaS also has some muscle behind it in regards to extensibility. Before getting too far in this discussion, let’s go through the IaaS installation process.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prerequisites</span> Script**

After going through all that you must be thinking, there has to be an easier way to do this. Well there is, thanks to [Brian Graf](https://twitter.com/vbriangraf). His prereq script goes through this process saving time and less room for error. It’s always good to go through the manual process at least once. It helps understand the process and good for troubleshooting.

The IaaS deployment can seeing daunting at times, especially going through it the first time. One piece of advice is to use snapshots during this process. They come in handy if you must revert back to a previous state of the deployment, just don’t forget to clean up when done. Also if you run into any errors during the IaaS install there is a link to open the installer log folder at the bottom of the installer. Once you vRealize the error of your ways, uninstall and re-install or just revert from snapshot.
