At this point we have deployed &amp; configured SSO, of course with HA and backups in mind. The next piece is the vRealize Automation appliance (vRA). The vRA appliance provides cloud management &amp; a self-service portal for vRA. We are now going walk through the deployment and configuration of the appliance.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Prerequisites**</span>

- DNS (forward / reverse) entry.
- Network Time Protocol (NTP).
- 2 vCPU / 8 GB of RAM / 30 GB of storage.
- Administrator@vsphere.local account (SSO host).

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Database**</span>

The vRA appliance uses Postgres, but you have options in its placement:

**Option 1:** Use the initial vPostgres that is created on the first vRA appliance.  
**Option 2:** Install Postgres on a separate server.  
**Option 3:** Install Postgres on several servers to establish HA.  
**Option 4:** Configure vRA Appliance as a standalone Postgres database.

To find out more about the supported databases for the vRA appliance, check out the [vCloud Automation Center Support Matrix](https://www.vmware.com/pdf/vcloud-automation-center-61-support-matrix.pdf).

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Ports Required for vRA Appliance**</span>

The vRA [Install &amp; Configure](http://pubs.vmware.com/vCAC-61/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/vcloud-automation-center-61-installation-and-configuration.pdf) document provides the required ports for the vRA appliance.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deploying the vRA Appliance</span>**

<span style="color: #ff0000;">**Note : deployment of OVA done from the vSphere Web Client.**</span>

1. Log in the vSphere Web Client with an account that has administrator rights.
2. Select Hosts and Clusters.
3. Select an inventory object such datacenter, cluster, host or resource pool.
4. Right Click –&gt; Deploy OVF Template or use Actions –&gt; Deploy OVF Template.
5. Select Source location by browsing to the Identity Appliance file with either an extension of “.OVA “or “.OVF “and click Open. Click Next.

9. Select the disk format, VM storage policy (if configured) and datastore for deployment. Click Next.  
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">**Note: Before you click next verify the disk format is the one you selected, I have seen it change (refresh) after selecting the datastore in the vSphere Web Client.**</span>

13. Power On the Identity Appliance if it was not done in the previous step.
14. Verify that FQDN / IP can be resolved successfully on the network.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">\*Command Line Network Settings\*</span>**

To verify, change or troubleshoot any network settings prior to vRA appliance configuration do the following

1. Open the vRA appliance console or use SSH (if enabled).
2. Log in in using the credentials supplied during the appliance deployment.
3. Type “<span style="color: #ff0000;">**/opt/vmware/share/vami/vami\_config\_net**</span>“
4. Verify the current configuration by selecting “option 0”.
5. Correct or add any needed configuration, exit when done using option 1.

**<span style="color: #ff0000;">Note: I recommend restarting the appliance, if any changes were made and verify the FQDN / IP can be resolved successfully.</span>**

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Configuring the vRA Appliance**</span>

1. Using a web browser navigate to the vRA Appliance management console “https://FQDN:5480”.

There you have it we now have SSO &amp; vRA appliances setup, next up IaaS. One honorable mention for the vRA appliance is that is does have built HA, which will be covered in a future post.
