During my career I have had the opportunity to work as both a customer and partner. As a customer I worked for large enterprise environments. I did design, implementation, and troubleshooting. This was great but was all done within a silo, with a limited scope. When I went to work for a partner things changed. I got to see different environments and had to develop a different mind set. I got exposure and access to tools and portals that I wouldn’t have as a customer. Also there was more focus on learning and training. In each role I developed new skills and grew. I also had the opportunity to work and learn from a lot of amazing people.

So why am I writing this? I will be adding vendor to that list. Starting next week, I will be starting a new role at [Tintri](http://www.tintri.com/) as a Technical Marketing Engineer. This role will allow me to continue to expand my thirst for knowledge. I will continue to work with the VMware suite of products, but also expand. The opportunity to work with service providers, other hypervisors, and applications, but also dive deeper. I will also be writing white papers, reference architectures, and blogging. I plan to keep my personal blog separate, but this will allow me other opportunities for more and unique content. Also this will not affect my activities with vBrownBag.

It doesn’t stop there. This role is based at the Tintri headquarters in Mountain View, California. So you guessed it, I will be relocating to the Bay Area. I’m looking forward to this new exciting adventure that this role and move will bring.

Leaving the team at GDT was the hardest part of this decision. I got to work with a lot of amazing people. I’m thankful for my time there and the experience.

I also want to take this opportunity to thank the community. Getting involved with my local VMUG and then vBrownBag has helped me grow and get out of my comfort zone.

Wish me luck!
